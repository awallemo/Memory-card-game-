# Memory-card-game-
Memory card game created by using vue.js
The task is to implement a classic memory game using Vuejs.

The board is n-by-n, where n is your choosing (minimum 4).
The deck contains unique pairs of cards (for a board of n*n, we need n*n/2 pairs of cards). You can select the "theme" (e.g., places, cars, logos, etc.).
Rules of the game:
Cards are laid out in a grid face down.
Two players take turns.
Player flips a pair of cards over. If the cards match, they stay flipped over (or disappear), the player scores one point, and gets a bonus turn.
The game is over when all matches are found.
Use some animation or effect for flipping the cards.
Count and show on the screen the total time elapsed, the total number of flips and each players score
Show in the end which player won.
